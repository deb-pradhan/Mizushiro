Mizushiro Seed Deck Template



Slide 1: Title & Identity

Visual: The Mizushiro Logo on a clean background.
Headline: Omnichain lending for the $2.9T long-tail economy.
Sub-headline: "Aave for the other 90%."

Slide 2: The Problem

Visual: A split screen or simple diagram.

Left: A "Blue Chip" token (ETH/BTC) = "Bankable."

Right: A massive pile of 300+ other tokens = "Unbankable / Idle."
Headline: $2.9 Trillion in crypto assets sits idle with zero access to lending.
Bullet Points:

The Gap: Major protocols (Aave, Compound) only support top 10-20 "Blue Chip" tokens.

The Pain: 90% of the market cannot hedge, short, or earn yield.

The Consequence: Extreme volatility and billions in wasted capital efficiency.

Slide 3: The Solution

Visual: Product UI mock-up showing a user depositing a niche token (e.g., a specific gaming token) and earning yield instantly.
Headline: One-click lending for any asset, on any chain.
Bullet Points:

300+ Assets Supported: We unlock liquidity for the long tail that incumbents ignore.

True Omnichain: Powered by AggLayer—deposit on Chain A, borrow on Chain B with 0 friction.

Safer Liquidations: Partial (50%) liquidations prevent the instant "100% wipeout" common in current niche markets.

Slide 4: Traction (The Hook)

Visual: A large bar chart showing committed liquidity vs. competitors at launch.
Headline: $10M+ TVL Committed Pre-Launch.
Key Stats:

$10,000,000+ secured from ecosystem partners.

Strategic Partners: Polygon, Prom Network, Gateway.fm.

Infrastructure Ready: Backend fully built and audited by Gateway.fm.
(Context Note: We haven't just built a protocol; we have secured the liquidity to make it viable day one.)

Slide 5: Market Validation (The "Why Now")

Visual: A chart showing the PYTH token spike.
Headline: The demand is desperate.
The Case Study:

When PYTH (a $1B asset) had limited lending avenues, borrowers paid 45,000% APY.

This wasn't a glitch—it was market desperation for liquidity.

Mizushiro captures this premium by being the first market for these assets.

Slide 6: Unique Insight (Why Us?)

Visual: A "Competitive Moat" Diagram or the "Competitive Comparison" table (from your uploaded context).
Headline: Blue Chip lending is a commodity. The Alpha is in the Long Tail.
The Insight:

First Mover Advantage: By supporting 300+ assets first, we capture the liquidity network effects that make it impossible for Aave to catch up later.

Virality as Strategy: Small-cap communities are loud. Supporting their token makes them our marketing team, lowering CAC to near zero.

AggLayer Native: We aren't just bridging; we are using Polygon's AggLayer to abstract the chain away entirely.

Slide 7: Business Model

Visual: A simple flywheel diagram.
Headline: Capturing spreads on high-volatility assets.
Revenue Streams:

Interest Spread: We take a cut between borrowers and lenders.

Liquidation Fees: Revenue from maintaining protocol health.

Yield Strategies: Premium fees for "one-click" strategy vaults.
Economics: High-yield borrowing demand (shorts/hedging) drives higher APY for lenders, attracting sticky TVL.

Slide 8: The Market

Visual: A simplified TAM (Total Addressable Market) Bubble Chart.
Headline: From $3 Trillion Today to $19 Trillion by 2030.
The Breakdown:

Now ($3T): The current long-tail of crypto assets without lending markets.

Next ($16T): Real World Assets (RWA). As stocks and real estate move on-chain, they behave like "long tail" assets. We are building the infrastructure to lend against them.

Slide 9: The Team

Visual: Photos of the 3 Co-Founders with logos of their past experience (Gateway.fm, etc.).
Headline: Built by Infrastructure & Risk Experts.
The Squad:

Vasyl Kyryliuk (CEO): VP BizDev at Gateway.fm. Expert in Web3 strategy & partnerships.

Oleh Korop (Risk/Strategy): PhD in Finance. 7+ years in Web3 trading risk.

Andrew Skurlatov (CTO): 15+ years engineering, 10+ years blockchain.
(Note: We combine deep backend infrastructure experience with PhD-level financial risk management.)

Slide 10: The Ask

Visual: A timeline roadmap from "Seed" to "Series A."
Headline: Raising $3M Seed to capture the Long Tail.
Terms: $3M at $30M Valuation.
Use of Funds (18 Months):

Launch v1 on Prom Network.

Integrate Real World Asset (RWA) vaults.

Goal: Reach $100M TVL and Series A readiness.
